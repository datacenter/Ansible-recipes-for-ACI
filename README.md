# Ansible recipes for ACI
## _Simple yet powerful playbooks you can use_

This repo contains a series of Ansible playbooks you can use with [Cisco ACI](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/data-center-virtualization/application-centric-infrastructure/index.html).
The playbooks make use of [native ACI Ansible modules](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/cisco/aci/index.html#plugin-index) as much as possible.
They are kept as simple as possible to make them easy to understand and reuse in your environment.
Example playbooks you can find here include:

- Complete configuration of interface, interface policies, VLAN pools, domains
- Comprehensive multi-tier tenant configuration
- Configuration of common features such as NTP, DNS, BGP Route Reflector
- etc.
